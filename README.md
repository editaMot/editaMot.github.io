Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as a frontend developer.

## Projects:

Here is a list of the projects included in this portfolio:

1. Mountain Cabin. This application manages stays in mountain cabins, allowing administrators to handle cabin details, manage bookings, and oversee reservations through a dashboard. Key features include cabin and booking management, user authentication, and customizable settings for stay durations, guest limits, and pricing. The system ensures secure access and provides a detailed view of occupancy, arrivals, and financial statistics.
2. Audiophile. This is an e-commerce website, which features a cart system where users can add, remove, and edit product quantities with real-time updates. Users can create orders by filling out a shipping and payment form, with validation ensuring all information is correct before finalizing the order.
3. Nature Lovers. A web application offering a seamless infinite scroll experience for nature enthusiasts. Users can continuously browse nature photos with automatic loading, filter images by categories like Mountains and Beaches, and easily manage their favorites by marking or unmarking photos. A dedicated section allows users to view all their favorited photos in one place for quick access.
4. Aesthetic Beauty Salon. This is a web application for customer registration, appointment management, and staff authentication. Salon staff can register clients, edit or delete appointments, and use a search function to find specific records, with automated email confirmations for both appointments and contact form submissions. Secure access is provided through unique staff login credentials, ensuring only authorized personnel can manage client information.
